<span>I have learned how to create professional README files that enhance project documentation and improve collaboration. From structuring key sections like project overview, installation steps, usage, and contribution guidelines to adding badges, images, and a clean formatâ€”I now understand how to make a README both informative and visually appealing. This skill will help me maintain well-documented projects and contribute effectively to open-source communities.</span>
