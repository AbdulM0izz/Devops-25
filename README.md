# DevOps Learning Journey 🚀

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in DevOps technologies. It serves as both a personal learning tracker and a resource for others embarking on their DevOps journey.

## ✅ Current Progress: Git, GitHub, GitLab
I have successfully completed all key concepts of version control with Git and cloud hosting platforms like GitHub. Now, I am advancing my expertise in GitLab and focusing on Docker.

### Git & GitHub
- Version control fundamentals
- Branching and merging strategies
- Pull requests and code review workflows
- Collaborative development practices
- Git best practices and advanced commands

### GitLab
- Key concepts and architecture
- Repository management and collaboration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Security and access control
- GitLab best practices

## 🔄 Ongoing Learning: Docker
I am currently adding all my DevOps-related code and content to my GitLab group named **DevOps**. All Docker-related concepts and projects will be added under the project named **Docker**.

🔗 **GitLab Group:** [DevOps](https://gitlab.com/devops)

### Docker
- Container basics and Docker architecture
- Creating and managing Docker images
- Writing efficient Dockerfiles
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes (upcoming)
- Networking, volumes, and security best practices

## 📌 Upcoming Learning Path

### 🚀 Kubernetes
- Understanding container orchestration
- Managing deployments and scaling applications
- Service discovery and networking
- Kubernetes best practices and production-ready setups

### 🔧 Jenkins
- CI/CD pipeline creation
- Build automation and test integration
- Deployment automation
- Pipeline as Code using Jenkinsfile

### ☁️ AWS Cloud Infrastructure
- Core services (EC2, S3, VPC)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Cloud security best practices
- Scalability and high availability strategies
- Cost optimization techniques

### 🔧 Ansible
- Infrastructure automation
- Configuration management
- Writing Playbooks and managing roles
- Ensuring consistency across environments
