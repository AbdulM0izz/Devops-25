# DevOps Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in DevOps technologies. It serves as both a personal learning tracker and a resource for others embarking on their DevOps journey.

## Current Progress: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Docker, AWS
I have successfully completed all key concepts of version control with Git and cloud hosting platforms like GitHub. I have also advanced my expertise in GitLab and Docker.  
Currently, I am actively working on AWS core services such as EC2, S3, and foundational cloud concepts.

### Git & GitHub
- Version control fundamentals
- Branching and merging strategies
- Pull requests and code review workflows
- Collaborative development practices
- Git best practices and advanced commands

### GitLab
- Key concepts and architecture
- Repository management and collaboration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Security and access control
- GitLab best practices

### Docker
- Container basics and Docker architecture
- Creating and managing Docker images
- Writing efficient Dockerfiles
- Networking, volumes, and security best practices

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Launching and managing EC2 instances
- Storing and securing data with S3
- Setting up IAM roles, policies, and permissions
- Basics of VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and networking
- Cloud security best practices
- Introduction to Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling
- Preparing for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
